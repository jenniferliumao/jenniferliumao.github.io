Hi this is Peng!

I'm a master's student in Data Science with working experience in mechanical engineering and materials science. Before joining in [MSDS program](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science), I received my Ph.D in mechanical engineering and worked as an associate scientist at National University of Singapore. I have a passion for combining data insights with domain knowledge in real-world applications. 

My fascination with data analytics began while working on my last Ph.D. project. In that project, I built an end to end pipeline that automates data generating, data collection and data analysis for heat transfer measurements and published two journal articles. From then on, I studied as a MS student in Data Science at University of San Francisco, where I developed various skills including machine learning, distributed computing, relational databases, data structures and algorithms,  time series analysis and A/B testing, and I’m also proficient in Python and SQL.

I’ve worked as a data scientist in two internship projects. One of the projects that I am most proud of is working on a team to improve the prediction of airline revenue for a startup company [FLYR](https://www.flyrlabs.com/). My focus is on the development of a multi-step machine learning model that integrates time-series clustering and Vector Autoregression algorithm into the prediction process. This new approach improves the prediction by 16%. I enjoyed working with a team that had diverse skills, from domain experts to data engineers.
